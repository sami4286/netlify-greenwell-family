I was recommended to your office, and was so glad. I was scared and almost in a panic, when the receptionist asked if it would be ok for her to say a prayer for me and my fears to subside, of course i agreed. Dr. Safford along with his assistant and the entire staff made what could have been a horrible experience a fantastic one with very little discomfort and no anxiety. I have, and will continue to highly recommend Greenwell Springs Family Denistry to everyone.

I was recommended to your office, and was so glad. I was scared and almost in a panic, when the receptionist asked if it would be ok for her to say a prayer for me and my fears to subside, of course i agreed. Dr. Safford along with his assistant and the entire staff made what could have been a horrible experience a fantastic one with very little discomfort and no anxiety.
